    <img src="images/cookies.jpg" width="400px" height="auto" alt="A glass bowl filled with golden brown chocolate chip cookies.">
    <p>Crunchy yet soft chocolate chip cookies, made with demerara sugar to add a delicious brown sugar taste.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla essence</li>
        <li>125g butter, melted then cooled (still liquid)</li>
        <li>125g demerara sugar</li>
        <li>125g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>250g plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>200g dark chocolate, chopped into small pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift the flour and baking powder into a mixing bowl and mix together.</li>
        <li>In a separate mixing bowl, beat the egg, then add the vanilla esence and butter and mix together.</li>
        <li>Add the demerara sugar to the egg mixture and mix well, then do the same with the granulated sugar.</li>
        <li>Alternately add small amounts of the flour and the chocolate chunks to the mixture, mixing well each time. </li>
        <li>Use a dessert spoon to take enough of the mixture to make small balls of cookie dough. Pace on a greaseproof paper-lined baking tray.</li>
        <li>Bake the dough balls in an oven preheated to 190C/fan 170C/gas mark 5 for 7-10 minutes. The cookies should look slightly underdone with only a hint of the golden brown crust when you remove them from the oven.</li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking tray for 10 minutes before moving them onto a wire rack to finish cooling</li>
    </ol>
